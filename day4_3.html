    <p><mark>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </mark>(/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (audio speaker iconlisten); 15 October 1931 –
        27 July
        2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born
        and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four
        decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation
        (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space
        programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for
        his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a
        pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first
        since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]</p>
    <p><i>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata
            Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6]
            he
            returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a
            recipient
            of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.</i></p>
    <h2>Early life and education</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <small>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the
            pilgrimage
            centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His
            father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a
            housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between
            Rameswaram
            and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] </small>Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister
        in his
        family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties
        and large tracts of land. Even though his ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders, the family had lost most
        of its fortunes by the 1920s and was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born.
    </p>
    <p>Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic
        found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descendance from Arab traders and local women. Their
        business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well
        as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers in order to add
        to the family's meager income. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the
        businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral
        home.[19][20][21]</p>
    <h2>Career as a scientist</h2>
    <hr>
    <p style="background-color: black; color: white;">After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960,
        Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development
        Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of
        India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started
        his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam
        was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] In
        1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director
        of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in
        near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at
        DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more
        engineers.[25]</p>
